### Hi there!

<p> 
I'm a Staff Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.fortinet.com" target="_blank" style="">Fortinet</a>, in charge of developing Machine Learning models for cybersecurity threats detection and prevention. I am passionate about developing Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithms that can extract insights from very large scale log data, graphs and text corpus, such as Frequent Pattern Mining and Graph Neural Networks. Prior to Fortinet, I worked at <a href="https://www.datastory.com.cn" target="_blank" style="">Datastory</a> as a software engineer, working on analyzing social network data.
</p>

<p> I received my Ph.D. in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University in 2022, advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/jpei/jian-peis-homepage" target="_blank" style="">Jian Pei</a>. Prior to that, I obtained my Master degree in Computing Science from Simon Fraser University and Bachelor degree from the School of Software Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. </p>

<p>Please visit <a href="Zicun_Resume.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for my full CV.</p>

### Research Interest
I am interested in Cloud Computing, Trustworhty Data Analytics, and Data Pricing. My current focuses include:

- Interpretation on deep neural networks and statistical hypothesis
- Fairness on graph neural networks
- Efficient, scalable, and interpretable data pricing models
- Computation infrastructure for ML and MLOp
